<!--
Use this form if you've developed some BetterBravoLights configuration that
you think would be useful for others.  If we use your configuration we'll
credit you in the code, of course.
-->

**Software version**

<!-- Please indicate which version of BetterBravoLights you have. -->

**Modifying or adding?**

<!-- Are you modifying some of the configuration that came with
BetterBravoLights or adding an entirely new aircraft? -->

**Which Aircrafts?**

<!-- Which aircrafts are you modifying/adding?
Please include the manufacturer of the simulated aircraft, not just the aircraft name,
and for separately-installed addons, the version, if possible.
For example, "DC Designs Stearman 1.0.3" -->

**The configuration**

<!-- Please add your configuration here.
It's really helpful if each configuration line is preceded with a comment explaining where
that line comes from.  This helps us figure out how 'authoritative' the configuration is.
Checking the source code of the aircraft is _really_ reliable.
Checking the documentation/POH is _quite_ reliable.
Other educated guesses are _fairly_ reliable.

See https://github.com/RoystonS/BetterBravoLights/blob/f4574ea871ac09f1936b48478ef1f9be8ea13ff9/BravoLights/Config.ini#L110-L117
for examples.
