**Problem**
BetterBravoLights refused to install because my `exe.xml` file is corrupt.

My `exe.xml` file is located at

<!-- Put the path of your exe.xml file here -->

The error reported was

The contents of the `exe.xml` file are as follows:

I understand that BetterBravoLights didn't corrupt the file and that it's simply warning
about the corrupted file. But could you help me fix it?
