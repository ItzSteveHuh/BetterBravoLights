    "body": "This is a very significant release which takes us quite a way towards v1.0.\r\n\r\n## Release highlights\r\n\r\n- BetterBravoLights now comes with its own WASM module for reading lvars, with several significant benefits:\r\n  - FSUIPC is no longer needed; just unpack BetterBravoLights, run `install` and you're done. No need to download, install and configure a third party library.  If BetterBravoLights discovers that its WASM module is missing or the wrong version, it will offer to reinstall for you with one click.\r\n  - BetterBravoLights is now in control of its own versioning. Efficient WASM support from FSUIPC requires some significant shenanigans to match its WASM library to its WASM module, and there were scenarios where, if you already used a particular version FSUIPC, you would have to mess around with specific versions of libraries with BetterBravoLights. That all goes away with this release.\r\n  - We can now properly detect if an `L:` variable is missing. With the previous library we couldn't distinguish between a missing `L:` variable and an `L:` variable which returned `0`.  Our diagnostics are now much improved as a result.\r\n- Huge simplification of distribution zip\r\n  - The top-level distribution directory contains far fewer files, enabling you to find the ones you actually care about, specifically `install.bat`, `uninstall.bat` and `Config.ini`.\r\n- `AND` and `OR` now \"short-circuit\", making it generally safe to use unknown `L:` or `A:` variables in an expression: missing values will no longer cause an entire expression to fail if the rest of it is able to resolve to a value; for instance:\r\n  - `expr1 OR expr2` will evaluate to `true` if `expr1` is `true` irrespective of the value or error state of `expr2`.\r\n  - `expr1 AND expr2` will evaluate to `false` if `expr1` is `false` irrespective of the value or error state of `expr2`.\r\n- significant improvement in efficiency for detecting `A:` variable changes\r\n- corrected unsubscribe of `A:` variables\r\n  - unfortunately, it turned out that _many_ online tutorials on subscribing to and unsubscribing from `A:` variables were completely wrong, so previous versions of BetterBravoLights didn't _quite_ unsubscribe correctly. We now do.\r\n- lights are now disabled when in the simulator main menu\r\n\r\nNew aircraft configuration:\r\n- [Grumman Goose](https://flightsim.to/file/19718/grumman-goose-g21a-redux-ii) oil + pressure lights\r\n\r\nThanks to @xDalle1 for diagnostic and fault-finding help!\r\n",

It's working and contains hard-coded expressions for the A-10C. Note: requires DCS-BIOS\r\n\r\nDo you have an opinion on how the 'Anti Ice' annunciator should work? The configuration for most planes right now is that the light is lit if NO pitot/anti-ice is enabled. This seems rather simplistic and unhelpful. What _should_ it do? There's some discussion here: https://github.com/RoystonS/BetterBravoLights/issues/14 - please do chip in or raise a new issue if you have some insight!\r\n",
